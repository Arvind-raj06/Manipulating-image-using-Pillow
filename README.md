# Manipulating-image-using-Pillow-and-Automation 
  Here I have automated the task of manipulating the images from different format and save them with different size.
Please read the Prerequisite before executing the file.

# Pillow
  Pillow is a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL). PIL is a library that offers several standard procedures for manipulating images. Read the image file using the Image class. 
Some of the operations in Pillow are:

## Change Image Extenstion/Type 
  Use the save function with the required '.extension' you wish to change and as simple as it is.
  
## Resize Images
  Resize function resizes the image with the given pixel size.

## Crop Images
  Crop with the 4 parameters length and breadth for both the sides. Assign the values to a tuple such as '(300, 120, 600, 250)'

## Rotate Images
  Rotate function provides the help for rotation to the given degree in integer format.

## Flip Images
## Draw on Images
## Color Transforms

It will be cool to work with Pillow, just go on with it
